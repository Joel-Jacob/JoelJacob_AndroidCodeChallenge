Was 3 days / 12 hours enough time? Why or why not?
>yes 3 days was plenty of time for the project. We have done 3 projects so far on api calls and having only one activity/fragment decreased complexity

How many hours would you estimate you spent total on the project?
>5

Did you encounter any struggles while completing this? How did you overcome them?
>I have never used the search view and needed to look at the documentation for the correct usage

On a scale from 1-10, rate the complexity of this project (1 being easy and 10 being hardest thing you could have done)
>7

If this project was for a clien and you had more time to refactor what improvemnets would you like to make to the architecture and/or the project?
